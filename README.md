# YSOSpectrum
*******************************
This Python package is currently in the DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE.
*******************************
We are currently working on bringing a new Python package to study and characterise the spectrum of young stellar objects (YSOs).
This pipeline currently looks into four aspects of the spectrum:-
- Viscously Heated Disk
- Dusty Disk
- Magnetospheric Accretion
- Stellar Photosphere

## Viscously heated disk:-
This is the most important part of the spectrum as it is the dominant component to contribute to the flux.
